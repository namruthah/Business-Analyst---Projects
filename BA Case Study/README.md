## 📘 Problem Statement
The **Return and Refund Management System (RRMS)** is developed for **Shop Swift**, a mid-sized e-commerce platform, to resolve key challenges in its existing return and refund process.  

The current system faces:
- Inconsistent and manual handling of return requests  
- Refund delays caused by lack of automation and verification steps  
- Poor visibility for customers regarding return/refund status  
- High dependency on customer support for updates and issue resolution  

The RRMS aims to automate the return and refund process through a centralized, transparent, and efficient system — ensuring quicker resolution, better tracking, and improved customer satisfaction.
