# 🇮🇳 Tracking Climate & Ecological Changes in India

## ℹ️ About
This Power BI dashboard visualizes six decades of India's environmental data, including temperature anomalies, CO₂ emissions, deforestation rates, and natural disaster impacts. It aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights to inform policy decisions and raise awareness about environmental changes.

## 🧾 Business Problem
India faces significant environmental challenges, including rising temperatures, increasing CO₂ emissions, deforestation, and the impacts of natural disasters. Policymakers and environmental organizations require comprehensive tools to analyze these trends, identify high-impact areas, and prioritize interventions. This dashboard addresses these needs by consolidating and visualizing key environmental indicators over a 60-year period, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights
- **CO₂ Emissions**: Increased from ~18,000 in 1960 to ~720,000 in 2020.
- **Temperature Anomaly**: Rose by ~0.69°C (~31.5% increase).
- **Deforestation**: Forest loss grew from ~64,000 hectares in 1990 to ~72,000 hectares in 2020.
- **Natural Disasters**: Over 68,000 deaths recorded from floods, storms, earthquakes, and landslides.
- **Emission Sources**: Gas fuel contributed ~69% of CO₂ emissions; liquid and solid fuels made up the remainder.
- **Interactivity**: Year and category slicers allow users to filter data dynamically; KPIs and charts update accordingly.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Excel** (for initial data review)
- **Visuals**: Line charts, bar charts, KPI cards, donut/funnel charts, slicers

## 💡 Business Impact & Value
- Transforms complex environmental data into accessible, actionable insights.
- Helps stakeholders identify high-impact emission sources and environmental risks.
- Reduces manual reporting efforts across multiple datasets.
- Demonstrates capability in analytics, data storytelling, and domain insight skills.

## 🧭 How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in `powerbi_files/` using Power BI Desktop.
